Latest Released Version v4.5.0, v4.4.4.

#### carbon-multitenancy repo contains the the following component.

* tenant-mgt

The goal of multitenancy is to maximize resource sharing by allowing multiple users (tenants) to log in and use a single sever/cluster at the same time, in a tenant-isolated manner. That is, each user is given the experience of using his/her own server, rather than a shared environment. Multitenancy ensures optimal performance of the system's resources such as memory and hardware and also secures each tenant's personal data.
